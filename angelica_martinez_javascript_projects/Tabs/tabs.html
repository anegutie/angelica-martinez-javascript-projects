        <h4>Gooder Gurl</h4>
        <p>
            My name is Nova and I am a gooder gurl 14/10 times. I am eight months old and I am a staffordshire bull terrier weighing a heckin' fifty pounds. I love to play with my frens at the doggo day care sometimes. I have frens of all kind, some smol, some floofers, and even some woofers. I like to eat chimkin with my meals and occasionally my hooman boi's toys.

        <h4>Very Goals</h4>
        <p>
            I have many much goals for this year. I hope to always be a gooder gurl and never get a badder boop on my snoot. Maybe I can stay with my woofer frens sometime and we can bork at the moon together. I also hope to one day catch the smol mouse in the backyard because he's always doin me a heckin bamboozle.
